- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, butter is also added later while serving, you can add upto 5 to 6 tablespoons of butter too for a richer version
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 large red onions, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste 
- 1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 cups finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder

- 1.5 to 2 cups water or the stock in which the veggies were cooked or add as required
- salt to taste
- 12 pavs (dinner rolls) for serving with the bhaji
- 2 limes, chopped in wedges
- 3 to 4 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish

directions:
- Rinse, peel and chop the veggies.
- Pressure cook the carrot, peas, cauliflower, and potato in a pressure cooker or instant pot, or for about 20 minutes on medium flame.
- Heat a pan or wok. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter. 
- As soon as the butter melts, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds. Let the cumin seeds crackle and change color.
- Add 1/2 cup of chopped onions.
- Mix onions with the butter and saute on a low to medium flame till the onions translucent.
- Then add ginger-garlic paste. 
- Now add 2 cups finely chopped tomatoes. mix very well.
- Saute tomatoes on low to medium flame till the tomatoes become soft and mushy and you see butter releasing from the sides. This takes about 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium flame. If the tomatoes start sticking to the pan, then add some water and mix well.
- When the tomatoes have softened, then add the finely chopped bell pepper. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes. If the mixture starts sticking to the pan, add some water. You donâ€™t need to cook the bell pepper till very soft. A little crunch is alright.
- Add turmeric powder and red chili powder.
- Then add the pav bhaji masala and mix very well.
- Add the cooked veggies with all of the stock or water from the pressure cooker in which the veggies were cooked; mix very well.
- Season with salt as per taste.
- With a potato masher, begin to mash the veggies directly in the pan.
- If the bhaji becomes dry, add some more water. The consistency should be neither very thick nor watery.
- Do stir often so that the bhaji does not stick to the pan. When the pav bhaji simmers to the desired consistency, check the taste. Add salt, pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, or butter if required.
- Turn off flame and set bhaji aside.
- Now slice the pavs into halves.
- Heat a shallow frying pan. Keep the flame to a low and then add butter.
- When the butter begins to melt, place the pav on the butter with the white side face down on the pan.
- Toast the pav halves until they turn light brown and absorb the butter; set aside.
- Serve bhaji in a small serving plate. 
- Place a side of finely chopped onions, lemon wedges and finely chopped coriander leaves. You could also garnish the bhaji directly with onions, coriander leaves, and lime juice.
- Serve bhaji with the lightly pan fried and buttered pav.
